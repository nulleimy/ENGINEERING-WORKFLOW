# ENGINEERING-WORKFLOW

**ENGINEERING-WORKFLOW** is a portable, AI-native engineering operating system for creating, changing, verifying, releasing, operating and retiring software products at a consistently high standard.

## Primary engineering invariant

> Product cleanliness + Unix simplicity + DevOps automation + SRE reliability + zero-trust security + lifecycle-wide auditability.

Every change must be simple, purposeful, automated, secure, measurable, reversible and evidence-verifiable. The exact constitutional text and machine-readable interpretation are enforced by hash and independent CI gates.

## Constitutional entry point

1. [`governance/WORLD_CLASS_SOFTWARE_DEVOPS_OPERATING_MODE.md`](governance/WORLD_CLASS_SOFTWARE_DEVOPS_OPERATING_MODE.md)
2. [`governance/PRODUCT_DECISION_EXECUTION_CONSTITUTION.md`](governance/PRODUCT_DECISION_EXECUTION_CONSTITUTION.md)
3. [`governance/PRIMARY_ENGINEERING_INVARIANT.json`](governance/PRIMARY_ENGINEERING_INVARIANT.json)
4. [`governance/CONSTITUTIONAL_AUTHORITY.json`](governance/CONSTITUTIONAL_AUTHORITY.json)
5. [`governance/ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md`](governance/ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md)
6. [`governance/CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md`](governance/CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md)

## Operating flow

```text
INTAKE → FRAME → CLASSIFY → DECIDE → SLICE → BUILD → VERIFY → ACCEPT → RELEASE → OPERATE → LEARN
```

## Framework validation

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py
python3 scripts/validate_constitutions.py
python3 scripts/validate_primary_invariant.py
python3 scripts/validate_control_catalog.py
python3 scripts/validate_assurance_mapping.py
python3 scripts/validate_readiness.py
python3 scripts/validate_toolchain_lock.py
python3 scripts/validate_supply_chain.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For R1-R3 work, evaluate [`config/complexity-budget.json`](config/complexity-budget.json), assign a class from [`config/reversibility-classes.json`](config/reversibility-classes.json), register repeated manual work and link lifecycle evidence beyond Git history.

## Repository map

- `governance/` — constitutions, authority, invariants, ownership and change control;
- `operating-model/` — lifecycle, quality, complexity, reversibility, security, release and SRE;
- `architecture/`, `controls/`, `profiles/`, `assurance/`, `readiness/` — machine-readable engineering control plane;
- `documentation/`, `evidence/` — documentation, lifecycle graph, evidence and retention;
- `supply-chain/` — deterministic packaging, SBOM, vulnerability, provenance and signing policy;
- `templates/` — reusable product, decision, work and operational records;
- `platform/`, `policy/`, `open-source/` — verified enforcement adapters;
- `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/` — automated enforcement.

## Current state

The v0.1 foundation, v0.2-v0.5 assurance/control layers and v0.6 supply-chain assurance are integrated into `main`. Constitutional governance and the primary invariant are being re-integrated against the current mainline in a dedicated review branch replacing the diverged PR #8 baseline. The executable `ew` CLI remains separately reviewed in stacked PR #9 and PR #10.

The system is not yet `WORLD_CLASS_READY`. Named authorities, license/IP acceptance, real new/existing-project pilots, CLI consolidation, signed main/tag evidence and independent assessment remain required.

## Language policy

English is canonical for portable framework material. The two exact Czech constitutions are normative by explicit governance decision and integrity binding.
