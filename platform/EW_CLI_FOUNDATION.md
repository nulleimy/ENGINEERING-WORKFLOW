# EW CLI Foundation

`ew` is the portable, dependency-free bootstrap and adoption interface for ENGINEERING-WORKFLOW.

## Implemented commands

```text
ew init
ew adopt
ew doctor
ew rollback
ew self-test
```

`ew init` writes only `.engineering-workflow/`. It stages the complete controlled directory and atomically publishes it only when every record has been generated. It never overwrites an existing controlled project.

`ew adopt` performs a bounded read-only audit by default. `--apply` is required to add the control plane to an existing project. Product source is fingerprinted before and after publication and is not modified.

`ew doctor` verifies required records, profile/risk/reversibility consistency, manifest hashes, adoption evidence, undeclared files, symlinks and lifecycle graph references.

`ew rollback` is preview-first and removes only an unaccepted, manifest-owned adoption control directory. It does not attempt semantic product migration or source rollback.

`ew self-test` proves init and adoption preview behavior, atomic creation, doctor success, idempotent re-execution, tamper detection, source-fingerprint stability and controlled rollback inside isolated temporary directories.

## Safety contract

- Git is not required.
- Product source files are never modified by init or adoption.
- Existing controlled state is never silently replaced.
- Adoption preview remains read-only even when blockers are detected.
- Apply is fail-closed for unresolved blockers.
- Profile downgrade is rejected when observed risk or reversibility requires a stronger profile.
- Terraform, Kubernetes and sensitive-path indicators raise the observed minimum risk to R3.
- Symlinks are recorded but never followed.
- Sensitive-path content is neither read nor hashed.
- Scans are capped at 10,000 files and 256 MiB.
- `REV-3` and `REV-4` require a profile supporting R3.
- Generated records do not claim product, release or operational readiness.
- Failed writes are cleaned up before returning.
- Existing inconsistent state returns `BLOCKED`.

## Execution

```bash
./bin/ew self-test --json
```

The repository-native script has no external runtime dependencies and does not require Git. Distribution packaging remains deferred until license and intellectual-property authority are accepted.

The detailed adoption and rollback contract is defined in [`EW_ADOPT_FOUNDATION.md`](EW_ADOPT_FOUNDATION.md).

## Deliberately deferred

Semantic migration, project-specific golden paths, upgrades, post-acceptance rollback, provider adapters, release signing and remote evidence storage are separate governed slices.
